# Voice Recognition Performance Check
The Voice Recognition Performance Check (VRPC) seeks to identify which algorithms are most accurate at recognizing voices in sound records collected in an unconstrained manner.  It also seeks to assess the limits of recognition and to understand when algorithms fail.  The term unconstrained refers to sounds records for which there is weak control of the record conditions and the behavior of the human subject.
